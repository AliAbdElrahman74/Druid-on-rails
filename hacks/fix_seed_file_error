Seeding is not just forcing data inside a database. 
Seeding makes ActiveRecord evaluate completely the models involved. 
Then, your error may be anywhere inside your models and then checking your methods is necessary. 

Whenever you have a seeding error, check the models involved, not just the values you are seeding
